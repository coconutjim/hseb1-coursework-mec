# hseb1-coursework-mec
2013\. Study project (coursework at 1st bachelor course). C# desktop app with the implementation of Mind Evolutionary Computation (MEC, evolutionary algorithm), dynamic visualisation provided.
## Structure
* MEC_CL - library with MEC algorithm
* MEC_Form - GUI
## Features
1. Implementation of MEC algorithm (similartaxis and dissimilation)
2. Customizing function to be optimzed (2-, 3- or 4-dimensional functions available + user input) and search bounds
3. Customizing algorithm parameters (population size, Omega)
4. Interactive plot view
5. Interactive dynamic algorithm visualization for 2D functions (instant and step-by-step running)
6. Automized multiple (up to 100000000) launches and writing result to a file for analyzing statistics
## Technology
C# (Windows.Forms, ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker, OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL)
